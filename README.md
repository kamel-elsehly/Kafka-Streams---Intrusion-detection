# Kafka-Streams---Intrusion-detection
- In this project, there are two problems: 
  - Network Intrusion Detection problem in which I will perform binary class classification and predict whether there is an attack or not. 
  - IOT Botnet Attack Detection problem in which I will perform multiclass classification and predict is the case is normal or a specific type of attack.
- For each one of these problems, I will implement two predictive modeling solutions:
  - one static solution 
  - another solution that adapts through time.
